Project 1:<h3> Campus Recruitment Overview</h3> <br>
![image](https://www.plum.io/hubfs/Future%20of%20Campus%20Recruitment@2x-1.png) <br>
This data set consists of Placement data of students in a XYZ campus. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students
Questions
Which factor influenced a candidate in getting placed?
Does percentage matters for one to get placed?
Which degree specialization is much demanded by corporate?
Play with the data conducting all statistical tests. <br>

Context
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

Context
Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.

Context
In this notebook we'll try to classify image using Tensorflow
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. <br>
'buildings' -> 0, <br>
'forest' -> 1, <br>
'glacier' -> 2, <br>
'mountain' -> 3, <br>
'sea' -> 4, <br>
'street' -> 5  <br>

![image](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/online-cinema-art-movie-watching-260nw-586719869.jpg) <br>

Context
This Dataset contains the data of market analysis built on The Numbers unique categorization system, which uses 6 different criteria to identify a movie. All movies released since 1995 are categorized according to the following attributes: Creative type (factual, contemporary fiction, fantasy etc.), Source (book, play, original screenplay etc.), Genre (drama, horror, documentary etc.), MPAA rating, Production method (live action, digital animation etc.) and Distributor. In order to provide a fair comparison between movies released in different years, all rankings are based on ticket sales, which are calculated using average ticket prices announced by the MPAA in their annual state of the industry report.
