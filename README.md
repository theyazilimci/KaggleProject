Context
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

Context
Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.

Project 5: <h3>Hollywood Market</h3> <br>
![image](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/online-cinema-art-movie-watching-260nw-586719869.jpg) <br>

Context
This Dataset contains the data of market analysis built on The Numbers unique categorization system, which uses 6 different criteria to identify a movie. All movies released since 1995 are categorized according to the following attributes: Creative type (factual, contemporary fiction, fantasy etc.), Source (book, play, original screenplay etc.), Genre (drama, horror, documentary etc.), MPAA rating, Production method (live action, digital animation etc.) and Distributor. In order to provide a fair comparison between movies released in different years, all rankings are based on ticket sales, which are calculated using average ticket prices announced by the MPAA in their annual state of the industry report.

Project 7: <h3>Covid Vaccination Dataset </h3> <br>
![image](https://www.interpol.int/var/interpol/storage/images/7/1/4/0/230417-1-eng-GB/Cyber_preview.jpg) <br>

Context
Data is collected daily from Our World in Data GitHub repository for covid-19, merged and uploaded. Country level vaccination data is gathered and assembled in one single file. Then, this data file is merged with locations data file to include vaccination sources information. A second file, with manufacturers information, is included.

Project 8: <h3>Satellite Classification using CNN  </h3> <br>

Context
The past years have witnessed great progress on remote sensing (RS) image interpretation and its wide applications. With RS images becoming more accessible than ever before, there is an increasing demand for the automatic interpretation of these images. In this context, the benchmark datasets serve as essential prerequisites for developing and testing intelligent interpretation algorithms. After reviewing existing benchmark datasets in the research community of RS image interpretation, this article discusses the problem of how to efficiently prepare a suitable benchmark dataset for RS image interpretation. Specifically, we first analyze the current challenges of developing intelligent algorithms for RS image interpretation with bibliometric investigations. We then present the general guidance on creating benchmark datasets in efficient manners. Following the presented guidance, we also provide an example on building RS image dataset, i.e., Million-AID, a new large-scale benchmark dataset containing a million instances for RS image scene classification. Several challenges and perspectives in RS image annotation are finally discussed to facilitate the research in benchmark dataset construction. We do hope this paper will provide the RS community an overall perspective on constructing large-scale and practical image datasets for further research, especially data-driven ones.
